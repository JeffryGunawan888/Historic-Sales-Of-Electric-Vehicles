## About Dataset
The Global EV Outlook is an annual publication that identifies and discusses recent developments in electric mobility across the globe. 
It is developed with the support of the members of the Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI).

Combining historical analysis with projections to 2030, the report examines key areas of interest such as electric vehicle and charging infrastructure deployment, energy use, 
CO2 emissions, battery demand and related policy developments. The report includes policy recommendations that incorporate lessons learned from leading markets to inform policy makers 
and stakeholders with regard to policy frameworks and market systems for electric vehicle adoption.
